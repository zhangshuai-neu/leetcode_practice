You are given a string, s, and a list of words, words, that are all 
of the same length. Find all starting indices of substring(s) in s 
that is a concatenation(关联) of each word in words exactly once and 
without any intervening(间隔) characters.

Example 1:

Input: 
  s = "barfoothefoobarman",
  words = ["foo","bar"]
Output: [0,9]
Explanation: Substrings starting at index 0 and 9 are "barfoo" and 
"foobar" respectively. The output order does not matter, returning 
[9,0] is fine too.

Example 2:

Input:
  s = "wordgoodstudentgoodword",
  words = ["word","student"]
Output: []
